# defHacks---Covid19

This was the Interactive Covid Simulation that me and my partner created for defHacks (hackathon). It is designed to help teach individuals the process that invovles getting infected, recovery, and/or deaths of Covid-19 (in a sample population). It also shows some features that could help slow down and prevent the spread of this disease. If we were to continue this project we would add more interactive components that can be utilized and make learning more interesting for our audience.
